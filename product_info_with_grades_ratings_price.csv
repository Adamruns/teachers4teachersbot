When students are not following behavior expectations, Fix-It Tickets are a constructive next step in your classroom behavior management plan. Rather than just tell a child what they are doing wrong, this think sheet allows for a more effective way of having students evaluate their own behavior and think about WHY they should work to fix it.
After the student fills out this think sheet, it can be used as a jumping off point for discussion when you pull them aside to talk privately about how they can make it right. You can choose whether you want to send their Fix-It Ticket home to parents or not, or it could be useful to show parents at a conference.
This classroom management resource includes a ready-to-print template as well as an editable version to customize with your own positive behavior expectations.
Here's what teaching are saying about these classroom management behavior reflection sheets:
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “These are making such a HUGE impact on the behavior in my classroom!!! I love that I was able to edit it to fit my needs!  My students are behaving so much better now, knowing they may have to take this ticket home to get signed by a guardian.”
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ ""This is such a great resource to hold students accountable, enable them to learn from their mistakes, and communicate with parents as well. Highly recommend!""
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “After implementing, infractions reduced dramatically.""
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “This has been so helpful! I use this ticket when they need to have a talk about their behavior. I go over the questions with them, but I also have the parents go over the questions with them. Working perfectly!”

This is an effective classroom behavior management intervention to help with excessive blurting, for whole group or individual students.
It is also a great incentive to add to your classroom management system toward the end of the school year when blurting and chattiness might be reaching an all time high.
This classroom behavior management lesson for blurting includes:
Detailed teacher guidelines and tools for a lesson on when it is okay and not okay to talk in the classroom, and WHY.
""Catch a Bubble"" cards
Matching poster
""Oops, I Popped a Bubble"" reflection slips
The blurt lesson uses these terms:
“Catch a bubble”- to not talk, as if they have a bubble in their mouth
“Pop a bubble”- to talk, as if they’re pretending the bubble has popped
Students are given specific scenarios (shown on cards). They decide which of the above categories each example should fall into. These cards can be sorted/displayed on the provided poster. For example, “when the teacher is giving directions” would go on the “catch a bubble” side. Pre-made cards are included, but you can easily be customize the scenarios with sticky notes or by writing directly on a laminated poster.
""Catch a Bubble"" cards and a matching poster are also included. Whenever students talk at an inappropriate time, they “pop” one of their 5 bubbles by crossing it out with a white board marker. These cards can be displayed on the poster, taped onto students' individual desks, or kept in student folders.
You might choose to reward students who still have unpopped bubbles by the end of the week with the chance to chew bubble gum during a designated time in class! If there is a student who does not like bubble gum or is not allowed to have bubble gum per parents, etc., you can give those students an alternative reward.
With this download, you also get ""Oops, I Popped a Bubble"" slips. You could have students fill out this slip whenever they pop a bubble or if they have popped all 5 bubbles, etc. It can be used as a self-reflection, a jumping off point for a teacher/student conversation, etc. If you have students who are repeat offenders with blurting, you might opt to send it home to be signed by a parent.
Teachers LOVE this classroom behavior management resource!
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ""This has been the best resource for blurting in my class. I have tried everything under the sun and this has been the first thing that has worked to curb the shouting out in my class.""
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ""This is a great way to remind students when it is appropriate to talk and when they should be listening.""
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ""This was super helpful for a very chatty class. We used it mostly after coming back from Winter Break. My students LOVED earning a piece of gum and were super encouraging toward each other.""
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ""This helped my class focus on not interrupting their classmates while they were speaking, especially during those last weeks of school!""

Providing a student with this file folder visual support may allow him to express his needs without having to find the words.
While this visual was designed for students with autism, it can be beneficial for any struggling students. Even verbal students can have trouble retrieving the words or articulating what they need.
Offering this simple visual can aid a student in saying ""I feel confused. I need help"" or ""I feel frustrated. I need a break.""
Contents:
6 pages of feelings cards
15 feelings in a variety of image options
1 page of needs
Sentence starters
File folder labels
Prep instructions
Suggestions for use
This is not meant to be a choice board for 'wants' which is why toys, computer, iPad etc is not provided. Rather this is a support to use when a student is struggling, overstimulated, frustrated, overwhelmed, sick, upset, tired, confused etc.
Teachers, paras, aides and therapists who have built a relationship with a student can often guess what the student feels and needs in these moments. However, responding to an outburst, problem behavior or refusal with what they are likely looking for reinforces an improper way to request those things. This visual support can help students learn to ask appropriately!

⭐ Teachers like you love this resource ⭐
This resource was a great addition to the communication support I use for my students. I was able to choose a few options at a time for them to choose from and the product comes with many pictures for wants/needs.
I love this resource! This has been super helpful with SEL learning and helping kiddos identify what they need and avoiding meltdown. It was easy to put together and it has been a great addition to my classroom!
This has been great for my non-verbal and limited verbal to express their needs! The choices are great and it makes a perfect connection between feelings and needs.
As we move toward more and more SEL practices, this resource is great at helping students identify how they are feeling and what they can do to help themselves.","PreK: 65, K: 173, 1st: 163, 2nd: 155, 3rd: 111, 4th: 70, 5th: 62","4.84","1278","2.00","https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Special-Education-Autism-Visual-Behavior-Management-SEL-File-Folder-Break-Card-1189958"

This is my go-to system for whole-class behavior management.
Students are instantly engaged and work hard to earn pieces toward a reward. By using different themes after each reward, students remain highly engaged for the entire year!
Teachers love behavior incentives because they:
are an easy and manageable whole class behavior management system
focus on positive behaviors
encourage students to work together
require minimal space (only as big as a piece of paper)
include a variety of themes and options for differentiation
create instant student buy in and engagement
Each theme includes goals for:
5 pieces
10 pieces
15 pieces
20 pieces
Positive classroom behavior management incentives can be used:
Whole Class
Small Groups
Student Teams
Individual Student
Positive classroom behavior management incentives can be used for:
Homework
Attendance
Class Compliments
No blurts
Kindness
Transitions
On task
Routines and Procedures (chairs pushed in, name on paper, etc...)
What positive classroom behavior management looks like in my classroom:
We work hard to have great hallway behavior, and often other teachers or staff members notice our great behavior and give us a compliment.
Whenever we earn a compliment, we add a “piece” to our incentive chart. Once we reach a certain number, we have some sort of reward (piece of candy or gum, shoes off in the classroom, movie and popcorn, small snack, etc…).
What Does Ultimate Bundle Mean?
This is a never-ending growing bundle. Any and all future class behavior incentives will be added. As I create additional class behavior incentives, they will be added to this bundle. If you purchase this set now - you will receive all of the next sets for free!

What Makes These ""Think Sheets"" Unique?
These think sheets avoid a shame-based narrative (i.e. the notion that the student ""is bad""). Rather, they focus on how the student made a ""bad"" choice, but is not a ""bad"" person. By focusing on the behavior, and not on the person, it helps students learn from their mistakes, to take responsibility and accountability for the choices they made, to identify the skills that can be worked on, and to repair relationships.
What's Included:
10 question or 6 question Repair Plan forms (in printable PDF and digital Google Slides™ formats)
5 different formats for differentiated instruction
Interactive Choice Board
Google Slides™ Mini-Lesson called ""Making Mistakes, Making Repairs,"" which touches on the importance of making repairs when a mistake hurts someone, in addition to teaching students how to use the Repair Plan forms.
Reminder Visual Cue Cards
2 Apology Letter Templates (full and 1/2 page) (Note: pages similar to those found in WholeHearted's Calm Corner Kit)

Here's What Teachers, School Counselors & Parents Are Saying:
My students have loved using this resource after they have 'made a mistake'. It is a very easy-to-use resource that the students can engage with independently while I teach the rest of the class instead of having to take the time to talk through issues with them. It has changed the way our classroom runs...""-Erin
""I love this product. My students with diagnosed Emotional Disabilities are able to look at their choices and hold themselves responsible for them. I don't have to do any of the talking or holding them responsible. With this book student who I have never been able to get to go back and talk about a situation have come up with solutions to make repair with other students and teachers AND FOLLOWED THROUGH with the plan. I would gladly pay $50.00 for this resource."" -Abby
""I have gone through so many reflection sheets and always struggled with the ones I had. This resource is AMAZING! The differentiation and variety is outstanding. I love that I will be able to use this regardless of my students abilities and the grades I teach. The language, visuals and use of restorative justice language wins my heart."" -Winnie
""I love this resource. From the Think About sheets that can be used for students who are able to write how they feel to those who need the pictures to help lead them to discussions this resource has been amazing. I love the apology and I statement notes. I have recommended this resource to other school counselors as a great resource to use with students."" -Building Strong Minds
My son has autism and we have started using these resources. I cannot praise them enough! They are perfect! The pictures, the tactile activities, the range of feelings and problem solving...I could go on and on. This such an amazing resource to use with him, I know I will be coming back again and again! -Jenna

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “This is the best behavior chart that I have come across so far! The kids love it and this chart really motivates them to behave in class. Overall, this is absolutely a wonderful behavior management tool!” - Caitlin H.
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “I have had a very rambunctious class, but with the help of this behavior clip chart, they have settled down and thought about their actions/consequences. Thank you so much for this, and helping calm down my rowdy bunch! I will be using it every year in my classroom from now on.” - Marcy N.
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ “This might by my favorite TpT resource yet! (for certain it is the one that gets the most use!) . This classroom management system works wonders for my 3rd/4th combo class. I added 2 more 'secret' levels beyond Awesome Day: clip on to the teacher, and clip on to the ceiling! Students were shocked the first day it happened. Surprising how motivating something so simple can be!” - Melissa H.
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  “FABULOUS! This has gotten my Kinders to take responsibility of their own behaviors and lets them help others by reminding them that they could clip down because of their behavior. The great faces allows the kids to visually understand what each colors mean. I love it!” - Sneaking Into Second

Enhance self-awareness, problem solving and reflection skills with our Behavioral Reflection Think Sheets. Discover a comprehensive social emotional learning program that comes with everything you need to run a behavioral reflection program.
●●● A Think Sheet is a very effective tool to use when a student is displaying unacceptable behaviors. These sheets can be used to help correct undesired behaviors and help students process their emotions and behavioral responses by understanding how their emotions impacted their behavior, looking at what it was that they needed, and what they can do next time they are in a similar situation.
▶▶ Add the Steps to Problem Solving Posters to a binder (I like inserting them into sheet protectors so kids can write on them with dry erase markers). Use these to work through the problem with the student. Once you are done processing, have the student fill out the Think Sheet.

It provides behavior management information, intervention ideas, and tools to use when supporting students with behavior needs.
The guide uses three different lenses to conceptualize behavior and behavior support:
Unmet Needs and Needs-Based Interventions
Lagging Skills and Skills-Based Interventions
Competing Motivations and Positive Reinforcement Interventions
For each lens, it explains the concepts behind it, clues it might be the right way to conceptualize the student, and several intervention ideas. 
It can be used both proactively as a learning tool to develop your own behavior consultation skills and reactively to intervene with individual student behaviors. A flowchart is included to help you decide where to start - which is a big help because this is an 80+ page guide!

This resource will give you 6 Editable Behavior Charts to customize to fit your students needs!
I have included basic behavior charts where you are able to input your students' daily schedule as well as behavior charts where students are given specific goals they must meet for the day or the week. You decide!
Also included are boy and girl options with two different behaviors mentioned:
""I Am Working on Being a Good Listener""
""I Am Working on Raising My Hand""

There is also a weekly behavior chart that includes ice cream faces rather than the standard ""smiley face"".
These behavior sheets are a great way to get students to take responsibility for their behavior during the school day! The editable portion makes it easy for you to customize them in order to fit the needs of your students!
See what other teachers are saying about how these are helping their classroom management:
""As a second-year teacher, and one that was affected by Covid-19 last year, behavior charts were incredibly hard to start and implicate. This resource is great to use and helps keep the task of charting behaviors easy! ""
""Easily customizable to the individual student.""

A First, Then or First, Next, Then board allows the student to choose a reward to follow a teacher selected goal.
For example, if you want a student to complete their work, you would select the “Do your work” picture goal and place it on the board under “First.”
The student selected incentive in placed under “Then” by either the student or the teacher. When the student has completed the goal, the reward is given immediately.

These are useful in school for general education teachers, special education teacher, specialists, and therapists. Many parents also utilize them at home.
Included in this printable behavior help download are
First, Then Boards sized 5” * 3”
First, Next, Then Boards sized 7.75” * 3”
Choice Boards with 8 boxes for desired rewards
29 Academically Focused goals for “First”
29 Life Skills goals for “First”
54 popular incentive choices for positive reinforcement
All boards come in colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, and white
First-Then and First-Next-Then boards can be used for students who need a little more motivation or for students who have behavior plans.
I often include these in IEPs for students who have a behavior goal. Included are printable boards with premade popular goals and incentive pictures and blank boxes for you to add an original picture to.
I recommend printing these in color, laminating and cutting out. Then attach Velcro to the cards, the dots, and the reward pictures.
I often use these often for students with autism in the general education classroom. The visual aids allow them to see the goal associated with a desired reward increasing the likelihood that the goal will be completed.
The choice boards are an important part of the First-Then & First-Next-Then boards. The student selects between 4-8 incentives that they are interested in working for. Out of these incentives the student then selects one to focus on for a reward. This picture card is placed on the First, Then board. The student is allowed to pick a different reward at the beginning of each new goal of the card.
If there is a goal or incentive that is NOT identified in this packet, please send me a message and I’d be happy to add it for you before or after you download. Great tool for how to help behavior problems in the classroom.

This classroom economy system is what I've been using since I started teaching and it is a serious GAME-CHANGER! Improve student behaviors by reinforcing positive behaviors. A classroom management tool you and your students will love!
HOW IT WORKS
I designed this classroom economy reward system to be paired up with Class Dojo. However, it can also be used with a clip chart or any other type of classroom management tool. Students earn ""Class Cash"" for their Dojo Points. They are able to use the cash to purchase coupons from our Coupon Catalog.
HOW IT HELPS STUDENTS AND TEACHERS
The reward coupons in this system are WAY more economical for us teachers. When you use this system, there is no longer a need to refill a treasure box every week! I've also found that students tend to prefer the coupon incentives over a simple treasure box treat. Rewarding positive behavior with Class Cash and coupons leads to improved student behavior and a positive classroom environment.

This CHAMPS resource has over 170 poster options to customize this behavior management system to meet your needs!
Stop behavior issues before they start with this organized system. CHAMPS is not a system of rules and consequences.  It’s a way to clearly communicate to your students in a positive manner making it easier for expectations to be met. 
CHAMPS communicates 6 expectations:
C - Conversation (no talking, whisper voice, presentation voice, etc.)
H - Help - (Raise your hand, ask a neighbor, ask 3 before me, etc.)
A - Activity - (Seatwork, centers, science, etc.)
M - Movement - (Stay in your seat, throw away the trash, get water, etc.)
P - Participation - (Actively listening, reading, discussing. etc.)
S - Success - (Star Students, Super Students, etc.)
Every teacher has different expectations, so to help customize this resource to fit your needs this version of my CHAMPS resource also includes some alternatives. 
For ""P"" there are also cards for post activity to communicate what students should do at the end of each activity. For ""S"" there are also options for supplies or signals that they would listen for when the activity is over.
You’ll be shocked how quickly your students catch on to this system! You’ll get fewer interruptions with students asking what they should be doing. CHAMPS gives students the non-verbal cues they need to be successful!
If you want to learn a little bit more about how I use this system in my classroom, check out these posts:
How to Successfully Use CHAMPS Classroom Management System
Frequently Asked Questions About CHAMPS Behavior Management System
Prep is quick and easy... Just print the cards that you want to use with your students and add them to a pocket chart.  Alternatively, you can add magnets to the back of your cards and use them on the whiteboard!
If you are looking for more compact signs that have all the expectations for an activity listed on one page, as well as an opportunity to edit expectations and clip art, check out my CHAMPS Editable Signs.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Jillayne says “Our school has begun using the CHAMPS behavior system, and this resource has it all.  I used this all day, every day.

By providing a designated and well thought out space in the classroom for students to do just that, you can reduce classroom disruptions, teach self regulation, and provide opportunities to develop coping skills that will last a lifetime.
Sometimes students are off task, impulsive, or distracted. Sometimes students carry stress and anxiety that is manifested in the form of impulsive outbursts, anger, meltdowns, crying, yelling, arguing, or other types of emotional release.
Students don't always know what to do with strong emotion and need to learn to recognize and regulate their own emotions.

This file contains directions and printables to create a behavior management area ""Take A Break"" station which encourages children to manage and regulate their own emotions and behavior and to reflect on classroom behavior and situations. It is a great alternative to behavior clip charts and time out chairs!

Discover the ultimate solution for behavior management in your classroom. This innovative system not only fosters a strong sense of community but also empowers students to consistently make positive choices.
By implementing The 5 P's and Behavior Expectations Scale, you will establish clear guidelines, develop a shared language, and set a positive tone that will resonate throughout the entire school year. This Positive Behavior System is effective and easy to implement.

With the added benefit of keeping parents informed and involved, everyone will be aligned and working towards a common goal. Say goodbye to traditional behavior management strategies and welcome a superior approach!
★ This bundle includes a trifecta of 3 behavior management resources ★
★ Behavior Focus Meetings
A 16-week program designed to revolutionize your behavior management strategies. By using read alouds to foster a sense of classroom community through good choices and positive behaviors, this resource is the key to creating an engaging and accepting learning environment.
What is included?
-16 Weeks of Behavior Focus Meeting Prompts in full page size and as chart titles
-In depth Teacher Guide Focus with all prompts, suggested discussion/talking points, and read aloud recommendations for each
-Editable bubbles for you to insert options for students to choose throughout the week
-Weekly/Daily Reflection sheets
-Bulletin board tools ('Behavior Focus Wall' letters + 'This Week's Focus'/'Today's Focus' heading)
Here’s How it Works:
1. Select a focus prompt, using either single page or chart titles.
2. Determine if you want to provide options for students or brainstorm collectively, then input them into the editable bubbles.
3. Introduce the behavior focus for the week by reading a suggested or preferred story aloud. Utilize the story events and suggested discussion points from the Teacher Guide to help students choose their focus.
4. Check in with students throughout the week to monitor their progress. Seize teachable moments to reinforce opportunities for goal achievement. Consider additional read-aloud sessions.
5. Wrap up the week with a Friday reflection. Commend students for their good choices and hold a mini-celebration. Encourage sharing of successes, emphasizing increased mindfulness in daily decision-making and lessons learned from the experience.
*Tip: The more you buy into it, the more your students will!
★ Behavior Expectations Scale
Effectively manage student behavior with the Behavior Scale. This scale, ranging from 1 to 4, outlines expected behaviors for the day, providing a clear framework for behavior management in your classroom.
You'll receive:
-Behavior Scale 1-4
-Title (choose Behavior Expectations Scale or Expectations Scale)
-4 Motivating Mini-Posters to encourage good choices
-Mini Behavior Scale for individual student desks
-Monthly Recording Sheets
-Teacher Tips for practical and effective classroom use
-Sample Recording Sheet
You can choose how you want to use the Behavior Scale! In my classroom, the behavior scale is displayed on the front board for students (and myself) to refer to throughout the day. Students aim for a ""3"" on the scale, which means ""Meets Expectations""... some days students will go above and beyond, achieving a ""4"", while other days students need to reflect on their behavior, receiving a ""2"". I write these numbers in students' planners at the end of each day, but you could use
★ The 5 P's
The 5 P's represent a set of norms for your classroom.
They are:
-Prompt
-Prepared
-Polite
-Productive
-Patient
-Positive
*There are 6 P's included to give you options. You can choose your favorite 5, or use all 6. There is a heading for ""The 6 P's"" as well.
This resource includes the 5 P's with student-friendly explanations/examples, and a heading for your display. The 5 P's can be an extension of your classroom rules, or they can BE your classroom rules! They are comprehensive and cover necessary student behaviors for successful and productive school days.

This classroom management approach is a highly effective tool for teaching students to be consistently mindful, respectful, responsible, and independent. It is also a powerful, yet discreet way to hold students accountable for their behavior decisions. When students know they will be asked in a respectful way to reflect on and correct their behavior, respect is given in return.

WHAT TEACHERS THINK OF THIS BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT TOOLKIT:
♥ ""PERFECT!!! This was the first resource that I purchased as a first-year teacher one year ago, and it is still my favorite today. R.E.S.P.E.C.T. is a great way to build a positive classroom community. The fix-it tickets encourage students to be accountable for their own actions and to learn from their mistakes."" - Leola P.
♥ ""This is an incredible program! My students understand RESPECT and we are growing in our understanding each day. I love how it puts the focus on them controlling their own decisions and behaviors!"" - Ashley R.
♥ ""This resource and the way the lessons are structured were perfect for my students. So often we talk to students about the need to be respectful, without taking the time to discuss exactly what that means. This ensured that we were all on the same page in our expectations, and gave the students ownership of the process. I plan to use this system for distance learning this fall as well."" - Jesse L.G.
CLASSROOM MANAGEMENT THAT ENHANCES YOUR TEACHING:
Stigmas of poor behavior created and reinforced by more public behavior management systems like clip charts or red cards are eliminated with R.E.S.P.E.C.T.
Overall, this approach to behavior management both promotes and demonstrates respectful behavior and is all based on the guiding principle:
Respect
Each other
Self
Property
Environment
Collaboration
Thoughts

In addition to providing a daily schedule, additional pages can be printed to create a portable packet that also includes specific information for each class/subject such as:

***MINI VISUAL TASK SCHEDULES. CLASSROOM. ORGANIZATION***
This product can be purchased individually in my store by clicking the following link: Mini visual task schedules.
This product is designed to help facilitate the completion of a work based activity/lesson or successful completion of different tasks/transitions over a short period of time. This is done through the systematical breakdown of the different steps within the activity through visual presentation. Student’s with Autism often find it difficult to follow and remember multi-step directions that are delivered orally, and subsequently may become anxious/frustrated when they are unsure of what to do next. Breaking down a task or a sequence of impending transitions into its multiple components, and then presenting these components in either visual or written format helps prepare the students for what is coming next, as well as allow them to complete the task with reduced adult assistance. This helps reduce the level of anxiety within the student and allows them to become more independently successful.
This packet contains frames/templates for different activities/part of a student’s day in which a mini task schedule can be created using both visuals provided in this packet, or to be personalized with directions specific to the student’s lesson/behavioral expectations/actions they need to follow during that time.
Additionally, to help the student organize the materials/items needed for different parts of their school day, frames/templates are provided so that the student can have a visual reminder of what’s needed for that particular lesson/transition (eg, library book, library bag and library card for the library, OR morning folder, reading book, pencil box out after arrival into school) and be prepared for their next transition.

An individualized visual schedule helps students diagnosed with autism as:

It helps the individual to learn new things and broaden their interests;
It provides tools that allow the individual to use skills in a variety of settings;
It can increase the individual’s flexibility;
It helps the individual remain calm and reduces inappropriate behaviors; and
It helps the individual to develop independence and resulting self-esteem.
In this packet there are 2 sizes of each visual (show in the preview) along with words describing the event in the visual, along with the same visuals (in the larger size) without the words. All 3 examples of the visuals are shown in the preview.

GREAT for back to school! You could even do it as an interactive whole group activity and act out/talk about each situation with your students so they understand the differences.
I have heard from Kindergarten teachers all the way to 5th grade teachers that said these activities really helped their students a lot with tattling! Read some of the feedback to see for yourself! :)
I also included a bonus cut and paste of Good Choices vs. Poor Choices. Enjoy!
*ADDED*: I have added 3 new pages that have picture support versions of the sorts! There is 1 Tattling vs. Reporting with pictures and 2 Good vs. Poor Choices sorts. If you have already purchased this, simply redownload to get the new goodies! :)
These go great to read along with the tattling books shown on this post:

Use it as a logical consequence for student misbehavior. The Behavior Think Sheet ties in with social-emotional learning by getting students to think about what they did, why they did it, and how it affects those around them.

It can also be incorporated into upper elementary and early high school classrooms.
What's Included in This Resource:

Classroom management tips with ideas for rules and consequences that can be tied in with this resource as part of your behavior management plan
When students in my class choose not to not follow the classroom rules they receive a Behavior Think Sheet. This allows them to reflect on their behavior and its impact on the classroom. I've tried essays and forms I've found online, but the Behavior Think Sheet I've created is the only thing I've used that really gets students reflecting on their actions. I three hole punch each BTS I get throughout the year and keep them in a binder for quick reference of past problems and student behavior patterns.

“Love it. Love it. Love it. Very clear and saved my first year of teaching!”

This is my go-to system for hallway behavior!
We work hard to have great hallway behavior, and often other teachers or staff members notice our great behavior and give us a compliment.
Whenever we earn a compliment, we add a “piece” to our incentive chart. Once we read a certain number, we have some sort of reward (piece of candy or gum, shoes off in the classroom, movie and popcorn, small snack, etc…).
These incentive charts can be used for:
- Whole Class
- Small Groups
- Homework
- Attendance
- Individual Students
- Class Compliments
- Student Groups/Teams
This whole class behavior tracker is part of my Class Behavior Incentives {A Growing Bundle}.

With pre-made posters for you along with a Google Drive version that you can fully customize you’ll find everything, you need to start a successful CHAMPS system in your classroom!
Stop behavior issues before they start with this organized system. CHAMPS is not a system of rules and consequences.  It’s a way to clearly communicate to your students in a positive manner making it easier for expectations to be met. 
CHAMPS communicates 6 expectations:
C - Conversation (no talking, whisper voice, presentation voice, etc.)
H - Help - (Raise your hand, ask a neighbor, ask 3 before me, etc.)
A - Activity - (Seatwork, centers, science, etc.)
M - Movement - (Stay in your seat, throw away the trash, get water, etc.)
P - Participation - (Actively listening, reading, discussing. etc.)
S - Success - (Star Students, Super Students, etc.)
This resource provides you with 1-page signs that you can add to your whiteboard for clear communication of your expectations. You can also create signs to place around your classroom to remind students of expectations in different areas such as the classroom library, centers area, or bathroom.
You’ll be shocked how quickly your students catch on to this system! You’ll get fewer interruptions with students asking what they should be doing. CHAMPS gives students the non-verbal cues they need to be successful!
If you want to learn a little bit more about how I use this system in my classroom, check out these posts:
CHAMPS Behavior Management Editable Signs
Frequently Asked Questions About CHAMPS Behavior Management System
Prep is quick and easy... Just print out either the pre-made signs or the ones that you’ve customized and add them to a visible place in your classroom. You can laminate them or put them in sheet protectors so they’ll last for years!

INCLUDED EACH WEEK:
↠ Group Rules: Suggested and DIY Group Rules poster so students can take ownership of the creation of the group rules and norms.
↠ Feelings Check: Feelings Check Poster to serve as a visual aid for students to self-reflect on their emotional state at the start of each session.

BENEFITING STUDENTS:
Each week students will learn self-control skills they can use at home and school to help them establish and maintain healthy impulse control. In addition, they will improve their communication skills and learn how to practice thinking before speaking.
At a minimum, being in the counseling group allows students to identify and share their feelings, develop self-control through participation, and practice empathy while hearing others’ experiences.
SAVING TIME:
With easy-to-implement outlines and activities, this group curriculum is very low-prep. Simply print out each session before students arrive and keep them in a file folder.
The included self-assessments are a great way to get students to self-reflect on their progress and you can then share this information with teachers, and parents, or in your program report.
How long do the group sessions take? Each session is designed to take around 30 minutes.
Who is this Group Designed For?
Wiggle Worms is designed for younger students (K-2) but it can be modified to use with a more broad age range.

COUNSELORS LIKE YOU SAID...
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Amanda L. says, ""The group of students using this resource loved the variety of activities, especially incorporating Freeze Dance into the lesson! As a counselor, I like the feelings check in! The little Wiggle Worms Lunch Bunch have so much fun and LEARN self-control in an engaging way.""
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Amanda W. says, ""I used this resource with a small group of 1st-grade students who were struggling with impulse control and behavior difficulties in the classroom! I LOVED every component of this resource! The kids were excited to come to group each week because they loved all the activities!! My favorite part of this resource is all of the movement related activities and games!""
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Jessica W. says, ""This has been one of the best groups I have done this year. I ran 4 sections of it (because these groups need to be small!) and they all loved it. Some of the students are needing a bit of a refresher, so we are revisiting the activities and they are loving that too!""
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Janet G. says, ""I can't sing the praises of this group enough! The kids loved all of the activities. I was worried they wouldn't be able to sit still for long enough to complete the activities but they were very engaged. I think the icebreaker activities in the beginning were super helpful! My kids even loved the name of the group. : )""

Breaks in your classroom can look different for each student.

Focusing on negative behavior can be totally exhausting. These adorable cookie behavior charts are the perfect behavior management solution with whole class and individual behavior!
Upgrade your classroom management tool kit with this whole class reward system and individual token boards. You can motivate students to work together to make positive behavior choices while helping yourself to focus on the good things happening in your classroom. It's also a great visual behavior tracker for individual students or your whole class.
Best of all they are seriously low-prep and they truly work! With easy to cut out pieces, all you need to do is print, laminate, cut, and add hook and loop so the pieces will stick. Then you're ready to start earning cookies towards a reward!
If you have students who need more support than your whole class plan, the individual behavior charts are a great option and they match with the whole class incentive charts so no one feels left out.
What makes this reward system work? The key is in the visual supports that are included to help you to be as consistent as possible. The cookies are adorable, but the picture cards for behavior goals and reward options help to keep everyone on the same page and to set a specific goal. This holds everyone accountable.
These charts will help you to make the switch from correcting unwanted behavior to focusing on the positive and watching for kids to meet your goal. The positivity is contagious and soon your students will be ""tattling"" in a positive way to tell you about kids who are making good choices!

Help student understand proper noise levels for behavior management. These voice level chart visuals will work wonders in your classroom. Posters and signs are effective at levels kindergarten through 12th grade. This numbers tool is useful for both general education students and students with learning disabilities including autism.
The volume control allows teachers and students to monitor their speaking level in the classroom room or throughout the school. Pictures, colors, and numbered levels provide simple, structured explanations for the various types of volume. Also include is a large volume control chart to post at the front of your classroom. Each of the 5 levels (yelling, loud, inside voice, whisper, and no talking) are printed on a full sheet of paper.
A ""printer friendly"" version is included for the Volume Control monitors. To accommodate all learners the Volume Control is leveled with both one through 5 and zero through 4. Use whichever version works best for your students.
This Classroom Noise Management set includes
☆ Volume Control Monitor with printable arrows (4 versions)
☆ Noise Control Monitor with printable arrows (3 versions)
☆ Voice Tone Monitor with printable arrows (3 versions)
☆ How to Directions
Because I've had several students with autism effectively use the volume control monitor to control their talking or shouting, but will continue to make distracting noises (humming, whistling, or general grunting), I created a ""Noise Level Monitor."" This has greatly helped decrease the amount of undesired noises in the classroom.
Also included is a ""Voice Tone Monitor"" that allows you to teach appropriate and inappropriate voice tone. This helps students process what the sound/tone of their voice means and helps them correct any tone issues which can increase positive socialization, peer interactions, and general well being. My classroom's overall positivity has increased and adult and student stress levels have decreased. Please see my preview file for examples!
Freebie Alert for all teachers of students with special needs IEPs or 504s in your classroom! Click here to get IEP Documents checklists with tips and a student observation template.
Print either the charts for the classroom or the small chart for a student to use in their personal space. I use the small one for students to keep at their work areas, in their folders or even wear on a lanyard around the neck. Glue the printed chart on construction paper or cardstock. Laminate and cut out. Use the supplied arrow and tape it to a clothespin. This allows the teacher to move the arrow to the appropriate volume category. If a clothespin is to cumbersome, use a paperclip to easily move around. Most teachers I've given this to use a magnet or a laminated arrow with sticky tack on the back to indicate the appropriate volume level.
See what happy teachers have had to say about this product:
""I have been using this in my classroom daily since purchase and it is amazing! My students respond to it and I use it during morning circle, I use it on the go, I have the small meters taped to certain students' desks, and it WORKS! Thank you!""
""This tool is SO effective! Love it!
""Not only has this been a great visual but it gives students in my class an opportunity to take responsibility and become self aware of their volume.""
""This helped in so many ways! I cannot thank you enough for creating this great product!""
""Needed this desperately for one of my students and it has worked well! Thanks.""

This tool is not only perfect to help roll out Expected Behaviors and set a tone for the year, but it is a great kid-friendly reference tool to keep handy in the classroom when expected behaviors are not met. It will also help hold YOU the teacher accountable and make sure you follow through with the logical consequences. The best part is, it's TOTALLY EDITABLE TOO! I've provided what I use for expected behaviors in different areas along with logical consequences, but you can easily create your own to fit your teaching style.
At the beginning of the year I present this as a power point. It helps give kids a clear sense of what will happen if expected behaviors are not followed. You could present one or two a day for the first few days of school or all at once. Then you could hang them in your classroom for continual reference.
I like to keep them in a binder in page protectors. When a child is not following expected behaviors I pull it out and flip to the correct page. Using it as a reference tool reminds kids that these logical consequences are put in place for a reason and you are going to follow through with them.
I also store the binder in my classroom library. This helps make it accessible for kids to reread in their spare time. Also, having it out constantly on display in a place where kids can see it will remind them of expectations and consequences daily.
Get ready to have your sanity saved with this behavior management resource!!
Expected Behaviors & Logical Consequences discussed:
sitting, listening and participating in class
traveling in the hallways
homework
classwork
how we talk to one another
respectful whole body listening
how we treat classroom materials
calm and safe body
recess
lunch
bathrooms
going to specials
dismissal procedures
**ALSO the ability to edit and create your own :)

This resource is your one stop shop for desk pet needs!!! Everything you could possibly need to implement desk pets into your classroom is here! Prepare to have your students excited and your co-workers asking what on earth you are doing! :)
I was surprised at how quickly my students ""bought into"" the whole desk pet system! It has been a lovely change to our traditional behavior management system and it has the kids on their best behavior! I designed this with Class Dojo in mind, but also included Desk Pet Dollars within the resource as an alternative to Dojo. Students earn “money” to purchase desk pets and needed supplies. (You will need to purchase your own pets, habitats, etc.)
Not only are desk pets fun to play with, but they also make sweet little reading buddies and inspiration for writing projects! I really wanted to incorporate ELA/writing into desk pets, so I am including lots of different writing options for your kiddos!
I included a TON of photos of how it looks in my classroom as well as tips and ideas. This resource will simply get you started! The more get into it...the more your students get into it!
Here is just SOME of what's included...
*Book list for suggested read alouds
*Desk Pet note home (pdf and editable)
*Desk Pet Adoption Application
*Adoption Contract (pdf and editable)
*Adoption Certificate (pdf and editable)
*Pet Store Price List (pdf and editable)
*Signs (Pet Store, Pet Daycare, Pet Hospital, Pet Spa, Adoption Center, Rescue Center)
*Backgrounds for Pet Daycare
*Numerous ELA writing opportunities
*My Desk Pet Journal with 64 writing prompts
*Desk Pet Suggestions
*Clean desk note from desk pet
*How Desk Pets Work in My Classroom with LOTS of photos and tips

It's an award system and behavior management all in one!
Why is it so simple?
1. Pick one of the six classroom money designs. Print the classroom money on cardstock, and you’re ready to go!
Emoji dollars
Generic dollars
Kid dollars
Monster dollars
Superhero dollars
Robot dollars
2. Start with a set amount of money to give students. I give my students 25 classroom dollars to start the new school year. For those that begin throughout the year, they get the same amount to start.
3. Decide on how students can earn classroom dollars. Within the implementation guide, I give specific examples of how they earn money. I keep it VERY simple. They have the opportunity to earn 10 classroom dollars per day. While classroom dollars are great for using to pay students for classroom jobs, I have found it to be too much and have found a much simpler solution!
4. There is NO need to buy and/or collect items for students to buy with their classroom money. All that you need is included, because student purchase coupons. These coupons were designed to use what you already have in your classroom.
5. Coupon Day is when student purchase the coupons. Students only buy coupons once a week (or as many times as you choose), no need to have things available all the time!
Coupon day is short and sweet. I can justify spending 30 minutes every week for awarding students, because they have given me 35+ hours of their hard work and dedication.
6. I truly believe in positive reinforcement, but sometimes students do need consequences. Taking recess is my least favorite consequence and is the very last resort for me! Instead of taking five minutes of recess, adding checkmarks, flipping cards, etc., when students do not follow expectations they “owe me 5”. When I say, “You owe me 5,” they know that they owe me five classroom dollars. My students DO NOT like to give up their classroom money!
7, As a result of my classroom expectations (also included in the Implementation Guide), I have used the same exact coupons and classroom money for the last four years!!
What’s included
A nine page Implementation guide
Classroom money in 6 different designs and matching binder cover
50+ coupons
Coupons include

EDITABLE CLASSROOM ECONOMY TOOLKIT:
Creating a classroom economy system that helps students practice money management, focuses on job responsibilities, and rewards students in meaningful ways is a valuable use of instructional time. Included in this toolkit are editable resources that will help you develop a worthwhile classroom economy system. This toolkit includes:
★ Classroom Job Cards: These 3”x5.5” cards are arranged with multiple cards per page for easy printing on 8.5""x11"" paper. Once you edit, print, laminate, and cut your cards, they fit perfectly into standard-sized library pockets, making them ideal for a rotating job board.
Each job title is accompanied by a short job description and behavior reminders to help your students complete each job successfully. Often times, students forget how to properly perform classroom jobs throughout the year. These detailed job cards are a perfect reference.
★ Tidy Up Tickets: Say goodbye to messy desks. These printable cards make it easy for Desk Elves to let their peers know their desk needs to be organized before heading home at the end of the day. Simply print the sheet of Tidy Up Tickets, laminate, and cut into small squares so they can be reused day after day during your tidy up time. Editable and ready-to-print versions included.
★ Students Job Application: Boost student buy-in for your class jobs by having them apply for the positions they’re most interested in. This real-world connection makes your classroom economy more engaging and realistic for students, and helps you hire the most qualified candidates so you know your class jobs will be completed carefully. Editable and ready-to-print versions included.
★ Job Application Tracker: With a classroom economy this engaging, you are sure to have multiple applicants for each of your classroom jobs. This tracker helps you stay organized so you know exactly who to hire next. Editable and ready-to-print versions included.
★ Class Cash: Make your class jobs official by paying students a salary. If you don’t have a set of play money in your classroom, simply print this cash on cardstock and use it for your economy. United States, Canadian, and Australian bills are included.
★ Class Passes: No economy would be complete without a little shopping. Give your students something to save for. Class passes are a no-cost way to stock your class shop with fun experiences. Have your students help you brainstorm the passes they are most interested in, and create your own collection of class passes using the editable resource. Need a low-prep solution? The ten ready-to-print passes based on favorites from my classroom are also included.
★ Class Pass Menu: Set a price for each of your class passes, and organize them in an easy-to-read menu that makes your class shop routine more streamline. Editable and ready-to-print versions included.
★ Teacher Guide: A detailed guide to help you implement your classroom economy system.

R.E.S.P.E.C.T. BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (Print and Digital):
This streamline behavior management approach is a highly effective tool for teaching students to be consistently mindful, respectful, responsible, and independent. It is also a powerful, yet discreet way to hold students accountable for their behavior decisions. When students know they will be asked in a respectful way to reflect on and correct their behavior, respect is given in return.
Stigmas of poor behavior created and reinforced by more public behavior management systems like clip charts or red cards are completely eliminated with R.E.S.P.E.C.T. Overall, this system for behavior management both promotes and demonstrates respectful behavior.
The tools included will guide you through 5 steps, taking you from preparation to implementation of the R.E.S.P.E.C.T. Classroom Behavior Management System.

The lesson plan included will guide you through assessment, discussion and written reflection activities that will reveal to students the truth about how carefully they follow directions, and help them make plans for becoming direction-following masters.

It is appropriate for both middle and high school students.
Immediately after a student fails to meet expectations, I have them complete this reflection. The sheet asks them to explain what they were doing and what expectation was not met. Students then explain why that expection is in place and what they should have done instead or a plan for to correct the behavior in the future.
The bottom of the sheet leaves space for a teacher note to parents (optional) and lines for teacher, parent, and student signature.
*I explain and model how to fill out this sheet at the beginning of the year before I need to use it.

FAQs

Q: Does this really work?
A: This system has been successful in over 2,000 classrooms! I've used it with my own students and found an increase in positive behaviors, classroom community and morale. Many teachers have shared that their students are very motivated by the changing theme each month and they are excited about earning their items and working together towards their class goal!
Q: How many behavior do you pick for each month?
A: There are at least 20 different behavior examples to choose from each month but I would pick less than 10 to focus on or it will be too overwhelming!
Q: Do you tell your students what behaviors you are looking for?
A: I do! I don't want it to be a mystery because I want to model, practice, review and focus on the behaviors that need the most attention. I have a blog post that goes more in depth to how I introduce these each month. Read More...

This is an easy tool for excellent behavior management in the classroom! This resource includes a Behavior Alert (for 'bad' behavior) and a Behavior Praise (for outstanding behavior) half-page note to send home to parents. This behavior alert note allows you to praise good behavior or send home a behavior alert.
These behavior notes may be used along with a behavior chart. This resource also includes a fill-in-the-blank student apology letter template for kids to write to a classmate, teacher, and/or parent.
I always keep a big stack of Behavior Alert and Behavior Praise notes on a clipboard ready to go! I only use the Alerts as needed. However, I try and send home a Behavior Praise to a student every few days. A great way to make sure every students receives a Praise note is at the beginning of the month, write each student's name on one. Keep track of who receives Praises & Alerts on the included Behavior Chart.
There are multiple behaviors you can check off on the Behavior Alerts and Praises and a blank spot to write your own. Three lines on the bottom are for parent, student & teacher signature.
Enjoy this quick, easy and consistent behavior management technique! This product also includes a FREE fill-in-the-blank student apology letter and behavior chart to keep track of Praise & Alert notes.
Read my recent blog post to learn more how I use these Behavior Alerts & Praises in my own classroom

Bundle 4 includes 5 volumes of my social stories: Volume 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5
Social stories are a visual and concrete way to teach students social skills and behavior expectations. Some students naturally understand social expectations and ways to behave, and others need more explicit teaching. In my opinion, social stories do the explicit teaching when done correctly. You can read more about the benefits of using social stories in my BLOG POST.
Why you should be using social stories with kids:
- Social stories provide explicit teaching that is easy to read and understand
- Students naturally take ownership in the learning process of the skill while they read
- Social stores serve as a visual and concrete reminder of behavior expectations
- Social stories include actionable steps and/or examples of positive replacement behaviors

Using photos, this sorting activity is another opportunity for them to SEE (not just hear) what is expected. Make a sorting board or use a pocket chart and pass out the cards. Have your students sort between “Good choice! and “We can do better.” You could also use them as nonverbal prompts when you see a student needing some support.
Use during large or small group. There are 26 cards and they come in pairs. For example “Picking your nose” and “Using a tissue.”
Each picture has an editable label.
What you get:
2 labels - 'We can do better."" and ""Good choice!""
26 unique photo cards, editable labels and two versions of each card:
Smaller cards - ideal for a sorting poster, or on a portable key ring.
Larger cards – ideal for a ring to flip through when wall space is limited.
Description of each card:
Picking your nose - I use a tissue
Coughing with no cover - I cough into my elbow
Putting your finders into your mouth - I squeeze a squishy
Blurting! - I raise my hand
Running in the classroom - I run on the playground
Pushing - I use soft hands
Breaking tools - I care for school tools
Fighting over a toy - I share
Laughing when a friend is hurt - I make others feel better
Hitting - I use my words
Butting in line - I take turns in line
Not washing your hands - I wash my hands
Leaving a mess - I clean up
Skills/Standards practiced:
SE/SS 1.2b I can demonstrate independence in a range of activities, routines, and tasks.
SE/SS 2.4a I can follow established rules, routines and directions independently.
RF.1 I can recognize print in everyday life, such as numbers, letters, one’s name, words, familiar logos, and signs.

This program was the result of much trial and error as I began my hectic teaching career, and is now my ""secret"" to a successful classroom. I have used this system in suburban schools where students just needed a little more motivation, and in challenging urban city schools where I felt overwhelmed with chaos - it has totally changed the atmosphere everywhere I've worked. GUESS WHAT saved both my sanity and my profession.
THIS PRODUCT WAS UPDATED ON 6/15/18 TO ADDRESS PRINTING ISSUES.
With GUESS WHAT, you can promote positive learning where students are recognized for exceptional behavior without becoming dependent on a reward for doing so. This is not a “I did my homework give me some candy” type of system, but one that will truly begin to run itself as your class transforms into a focused, respectful learning environment motivated by a job well done.
This product includes a Teaching Guide to support you while you teach and implement the program, which includes many tips and tricks that I have learned through the years. As with anything, success of this program depends on how it is used, so I've shared all the wisdom I've got. This is not a magic solution, but with work it could be the catalyst you need to transform your classroom, as it did mine.
PRODUCT INCLUDES:
- Printable GUESS WHAT tickets
- Printable labels for containers
- Classroom poster: ""How to Play GUESS WHAT"". Can be printed on normal paper, or as big as 16"" x 22""
- Teaching Guide and Assembly Instructions
- Instructional Guide PPT (editable) for teaching students
- Terms of Use
SUITABLE FOR:
Could be used at any level, but created specifically for middle school classrooms of any discipline.
REQUIRED PROGRAMS:
- Adobe Acrobat Reader (if you don't have it, it's free!)
- Powerpoint or a similar program
REQUIRED MATERIALS:
While GUESS WHAT is much more than a prize game, it does use a prize system to get students to buy in. Below are the things you will need to get started:
- Small prizes (I've always used candy, but you could use small erasers, toys, etc)
- Clear glass jar with lid (to hold the prizes)
- Short container (to hold tickets)
- Color printer (to print labels and poster)
- Packing tape (to affix labels to jars)

I am working for ______ board can be used for students who need a little more motivation or for students who have behavior plans. I often include these in IEPs for students who have a behavior goal. Included are printable boards with 44 premade popular incentive pictures and blank boxes for you to add an original picture to. I recommend printing these in color, laminating and cutting out. Then attach Velcro to the cards, the dots, and the reward pictures.
Want to see the I'm Working for Boards in action? Check out Caroline's blog post all about how she using the boards and helpful tips!
There are 3 different versions of the I am working for boards. The boards either have 3, 4 or 5 empty circles. Students who need faster reinforcement begin with the 3 circle board and then increase to the 4 circle board and then finally the 5 circle board. The supplied yellow dots (24) are transferred one at a time to the empty circle when targeted behavior is observed. When the student is “caught” following the rule or exhibiting the desired behavior, a dot is awarded. When the student collects all of the dots on the board, he or she pays the teacher with the 5 dots and is immediately given the reward that was targeted. I use these often for students with autism in the general education classroom. The visual aids and five dots help them see the goal and gradually work for it.
The choice boards are an important part of the I am working for boards. First the teacher identifies a target behavior on the choice board which is labeled as “My goal.” 41 premade goals are included for you to choose from. I strongly suggest that the behavior you are addressing and/or rules are visibly posted so you can refer to them often. Then the student selects either between 4-8 incentives that they are interested in working for. Out of these incentives the student then selects one to focus on for a reward and places it on the I am working for board at the start of an empty board. The student is allowed to pick a different reward at the beginning of each restart of the card.
See what happy buyers are saying about the I'm Working for Boards:
""Lots of differentiated options with a lot of choices to cater to students' interests.""
“I love these boards as do my students.”
“This has helped with some major behaviors. Thank you!”
“Great and easy to use to motivate students throughout the day.”
“These were very useful. The incentive pictures were perfect!!”
“Thank you for making a much needed tool for the classroom! Love love the ""working for"" system.”

-Polite
-Productive
-Patient
-Positive (alternate)
This resource includes the 5 P's with student-friendly explanations/examples, each on a half sheet of paper so they can be displayed anywhere, plus a heading for your display. The 5 P's can be an extension of your classroom rules, or they can BE your classroom rules! They are comprehensive and cover necessary student behaviors for successful and productive school days.
Behavior Expectations Scale:
A scale from 1-4 that outlines expected behaviors for the day. In this download, you will also receive a parent letter, explaining what each number of the scale represents, and 4 half-sheet posters encouraging your students to make smart choices throughout the day. You can choose how you want to use the Behavior Scale! In my classroom, the behavior scale is displayed on the front board for students (and myself) to refer to throughout the day. Students aim for a ""3"" on the scale, which means ""Meets Expectations""... some days students will go above and beyond, achieving a ""4"", while other days students need to reflect on their behavior, receiving a ""2"". I write these numbers in students' planners at the end of each day, but you could use this resource in a number of ways!
For more information about how I use the behavior scale in my own classroom, read my blog post, ""Behavior Management: Behavior Expectations Scale"" at createinspireteach.com
If you're looking for a way to revamp your behavior management system, and want to encourage positive choices in your classroom, this resource is right for you.

Let your students take responsibility for their behavior by setting a daily behavior goal. Then, watch their overall behavior improve with this behavior goals classroom management strategy!
How Behavior Goals Works:
Students will choose one daily behavior goal, and solely focus on it and work towards that goal throughout the day. You can display the behavior goals on a bulletin board, in a pocket chart, or at their desk. If they accomplished their goal, they can add a sticker to their sticker chart. If they did not, they can use one of the reflection sheets to write about how they can do better.

"Classroom Management System for Middle School: Positive Behavior Tallies","It's a simple idea: recognize the positive in order to eliminate the negative.

This classroom management system designed specifically with middle school students in mind is easy to implement right away. Whether you're feeling like you want to start the year off positively while reinforcing behavior expectations or you need a fresh start with your students part way through the year, this can work for either situation.
The basis of the behavior system is that the teacher points out what students should be doing throughout the class period, and the students self-evaluate if they are in line with that behavior or not by giving themselves a tally if they think they are. Tallies can be combined daily and weekly so that students who receive a certain amount get rewarded. This is a flexible tool that any teacher can put their own twist on and use to improve student behavior.
This product includes the following:
-Caught in Expectations Tallies sheet
-Explicit directions for how to use the ""Caught in Expectations Tallies"" sheet
-Ideas for what to give tallies for
-A Teacher Language Guide for giving tallies
-Reward Menu to use to reward students as they redeem their tallies
-Tallies Checkbook for students to track their weekly tallies and rewards
-Behavior Expectations cards for students' desks
-Independent work time cards so the teacher can quickly survey the room to see who needs immediate assistance
-Task Tracker cards to help students prioritize what they need to be working on
-Bucket Filler cards for students to give each other positive feedback
-Parent Post Cards to send positive messages home
-Behavior Reflection and Goal Setting form
-Refocus sheet for students who need additional behavior supports
To read more about this behavior system, read the post on my blog.

I put the game cards in the Target clear adhesive pockets for easy flipping! The behavior goal cards and reward cards are EDITABLE, so you can add any behavior goals and rewards you would like!
How to Use
1. Select how many rows you want your class to complete (2-10)
2. Select behavior goals you want your students to focus on (select as many you would like)
3. Print title, behavior goals, game cards, reward board, and reward cards.
4. Display game ( I used TARGET’S SQUARE ADHESIVE POCKETS. YOU COULD ALSO USE A POCKET CHART OR hole punch the cards and use stikki clips
5. Flip over a card when one of the behaviors is shown by the whole class

There is one social story for each of the following:
★ Whole group instruction
★ Small group instruction
★ Partner or small group work
★ Independent seat work
Story Features:
★ Each story's text can be edited right from the .pdf file
★ They feature Dot Dudes characters (clipart from Sarah Pecorino Illustration). These characters help make the stories appealing and relevant to children from a wide range of developmental ages and cultural backgrounds.
★ They do not assign a gender to the teacher (because guys are teachers too! :)
★ All stories have 1-2 sentences per page, and typically include a picture cue for each sentence. This makes them ideal to read to kids with short attention spans, and allows students to be more independent when re-reading the stories on their own.
★ The stories are structured so that the first half of the story consists of neutral descriptions of what the student can expect in a particular instructional activity, while the second half of each story consists of ""I can"" statements that describe behaviors the student is expected to engage in during that activity.

Token boards provide students with positive behavior reinforcement by allowing them to pick a reinforcer (reward) and work to earn tokens to get their chosen reinforcer. Token boards are great for special education classrooms, general education classrooms, fine arts classrooms, field trips, and so much more. There are options for using 3 tokens or 5 tokens depending on the needs of your students.
What is even more special about these token boards is that they are assembled in a way that allows you to store all of the reinforcer cards and tokens inside them. This makes it so easy to bring them anywhere the student goes which will help maintain consistency. I even recommend to make an extra token board to send home with the student so that their parents or guardians can implement their behavior system at home.
What’s Included: (3 token or 5 token boards)
*61 different token board themes with an EDITABLE text field for student names
*45 labeled reinforcer cards with easy to understand pictures
*1 page of star tokens
*6 pages of suggested assembly instructions
Using The Token Boards:
1. Allow your student to choose their desired reinforcer or you can even pick one for them. Then, place the reinforcer on the token board.
2. Every time the student completes a task or displays a desired behavior, give the student 1 token and have them place it on their token board.
3. Once the student has received all of their tokens, give them their desired reinforcer.
4. Remove all of the tokens and the reinforcer from the board and start again.
Tips:
*Make sure the reinforcer that you or your student pick is motivating for that student in particular.
*Provide an additional token board to the student for home use. This way their parents or guardians can implement their behavior system at home. Consistency is key!
*These token boards are portable. Make sure to bring them everywhere the child goes, whether it is to a fine arts class, field trip, playground, etc.
*You can also use themed mini erasers or even coins as tokens.

These behavior maps present the positive actions students should engage in when they encounter difficult situations (or situations that may evoke un-desirable behaviors) along with the positive consequences they will experience when they engage in these actions. Additionally, the problem behaviors are also displayed (along with the negative consequences) so that students are able to see the direct correlation between their actions and the resulting consequences.
***Purchase this product along with other supports in one of my bundles. Click on the link to check this bundle out:***
BUNDLE: Emotion, self regulation control and behavior. Visuals and supports.
In this packet are 22 set examples of situations/triggers, 2 positive and 2 negative behaviors that may commonly occur given this situation/trigger and a positive and negative consequence. These can be printed and shown to the student, or alternatively, it can be printed, cut, laminated and velcroed onto a title board (also laminated) to make the contingency map interactive. Now of course, each student is different and their exact behaviors and consequences for each situation/trigger may be different than the ones in the examples- not to worry- to account for this I have provided multiple additional examples of each category (actions and consequences) as well as additional situations/triggers so that each map can be truly customized to each child (blank tiles have also been provided).
Full packet contents:
Section 1
Behavior maps for:
Asking a friend to play
When friends don’t want to play
My teacher gives me work
I am given a direction
Things do not go my way
Walking in line
I want to answer in class
Sitting on the rug
I need help
My work is difficult
I am working in a group

Someone has something I want

Someone takes something of mine

It’s the end of centers
It is lunch time
(Provided are both a full behavior map, and then an additional blank title board/map page so the behaviors/consequences can be customized for each situation/trigger).
Section 2 (customization section)
This section includes all of the visuals used in the pre-made behavior maps (along with additional visuals to aid with customization) presented in tile format so that you can print, cut and paste to create truly individualized behavior maps. The templates include to create your own map include:

These classroom reward coupons are used to trade out after students earn a certain amount of points, classroom cash, stickers, and more. You can use this in conjunction with your own classroom economy system. The classroom rewards can be given a certain amount of points to redeem, depending on which one would have more value (or take more effort)!

Here is a tried and true solution to those chatty classes or ones that just need a little visual to see how much they are blurting. I used to give my students blocks, but they just became a distraction. With these blurt cards, you can easily manage student blurting by crossing off a circle with a dry/wet erase marker. This can also be done quietly without embarrassing or calling out students (my favorite part).
What's included:
⭐ 3 blurts (green, yellow, red or green, orange, red)
⭐4 blurts ( green, green, yellow, red or blue, green, yellow, red)
⭐ 5 blurts (blue, green, yellow, orange, red)
I hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!

By using the BEHAVIOR BOOK, you will create a thorough record of student behavior that will serve four important purposes:

1. To keep track of student progress, keep students accountable, and encourage growth.
2. To have anecdotal evidence to show parents.
2. To provide documentation if you need administration to step in.
3. Quite frankly, to cover your @$$ if anything ever happens.

The BEHAVIOR BOOK will help reinforce your rules and expectations, and students will quickly learn what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior. I strongly recommend this binder to anyone, but for new teachers or those working in challenging environments it could be a life saver. Truthfully, this book helped me regain control of my chaotic urban classroom in a calm and peaceful way.


PRODUCT INCLUDES:
1. Choice of 3 attractive printable cover designs (viewable in the Preview)
2. Teaching Guide to help you implement this system, filled with tips to ensure success
3. All 6 printable documents (listed below). All documents are included as ready-to-print PDFs, but also as easily editable Word docs so you can personalize the BEHAVIOR BOOK to fit your needs.

● DAILY NOTES – A quick way to jot down events that happen during class without having to stop your lesson

● STUDENT RECORD SHEET – A form to keep notes on a certain student, including infractions, meetings with parents, detentions, and other relevant things. This will serve as the “cover sheet” as you begin to collect documentation on the student.

● GOAL SETTING & BEHAVIOR CONTRACT – A form filled out by both teacher and student to create behavior goals to help the student get back on track. The student, parent, and teacher must sign this form.

● CONTRACT FOLLOW-UP – A form that documents the student’s progress towards meeting goals, filled out by both teacher and student.

● IN-CLASS REFLECTION SHEET – A worksheet to be filled out by the student when a student has received a certain amount of warnings for an inappropriate behavior and is sat away from the group.

● REMOVAL REFLECTION SHEET – A worksheet to be filled out by the student when he/she is removed from your classroom for inappropriate and disruptive behavior. This sheet includes a hall pass to and from another pre-approved location, like a neighboring teacher’s room.

FEEDBACK FROM TEACHERS:
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ This absolutely saved my life this year. (MsGTeachesStuff)
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ The strategies are so practical and easy to implement into the classroom. The lay out is clear and really systematic. One of my favorite products that I have purchased. (Joanne C.)
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Extremely comprehensive, with solutions that can work in many different classrooms. I got this after a terrible day with my worst class. This helped me set out a behavioral plan for my class and they have been doing better ever since! (Inspired English Teacher)
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Having some tools to use to respond to their behaviors in a way that won't exacerbate the situation is very helpful. I've been through the trainings, and I've been to the workshops, but having the information in a quick reference that I can copy and include in my students' folders is extremely helpful! (Virginia B.)
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Absolutely wonderful! I am huge on escalating rules and consequences, and this was exactly what I was looking for! Very thorough, well-thought out behavior management plan. Couldn't have found a better one on the site! (Anna W.)

⭐ Teachers like you love this resource ⭐
This simple and easy to use behavior management visual aid and flip book was such a great find! They are great for my nonverbal scholars as well as those who are verbal as well. It was a great way for my students to let me know how they were feeling throughout the day!
What a great resource tool to help my students make good choices and practically self-regulate and improve their social skills! Thank you!
I used this resource as a way for my students to begin to communicate some of their basic wants/needs without the use of a TAC device. It is easier in 'crunch' moments and is easy to attach to a ring on a lanyard for quick use in a self-contained classroom setting.

This is my go-to system for hallway behavior!
We work hard to have great hallway behavior, and often other teachers or staff members notice our great behavior and give us a compliment.
Whenever we earn a compliment, we add a “piece” to our incentive chart. Once we read a certain number, we have some sort of reward (piece of candy or gum, shoes off in the classroom, movie and popcorn, small snack, etc…).
These incentive charts can be used for:
- Whole Class
- Small Groups
- Homework
- Attendance
- Individual Students
- Class Compliments
- Student Groups/Teams

These print and go posters will keep class expectation on your student's minds all year long.
I created these posted to use in my 6-8 middle school classroom. As soon as I hung them up in my room I had other teachers asking for the resource to use in their rooms too. This no prep resource would look good with any classroom decor.
These posters are sized at 8.5 by 11, but can be resized as needed. Posters come in the PDF format.
*July 2021 Update - Now included bulletin board plan and letters
Tip: I have found that printing on cardstock and laminating works well to keep them lasting long. I also attach strips of magnetic tape to the backs to adhere to my white board.
Posters Say:
Be on time, on task, and prepared to learn everyday
Respect the teacher, classroom, other students, and yourself
follow directions the FIRST time they are given
Use electronics for educational purposes only
No cursing or teasing
Keep hands, feet, and objects to yourself.

Either way...this Visual Cue Necklace literally saved my life and lots of time. Simply hold it up and there you go a visual cue for student management. You will love the convenience of wearing it! You can give them to students to use to communicate their needs or have them available in a basket for teacher use.
⭐️⭐️ SEE PREVIEW FOR MORE WAYS TO USE THESE VISUALS ⭐️⭐️
I wore my Behavior Visual Cue Necklace with specific cards chosen for various activities almost my entire career as a teacher. I had more than one Necklace for various activities!
This was due partly because I had many English Language Learners in my classroom and I was also an inclusion teacher in that I had many children mainstreamed into my classroom.
This necklace was my favorite accessory and it was super because I hung it right around my neck!
When a child was having a bit of a difficult time, I would flash the “charm” or card I needed and usually they understood what they needed to do.
Of course we did role model and practice what each card meant and what directions the students needed to follow when I used one of the “charm-cards.” So...I decided to share this with y’all! I hope you find it helpful.

I have included different games with themes that are perfect for the different seasons throughout the year. These games will help you focus on a specific behavior that needs improved by the whole group. Once that behavior is corrected, you can move onto another behavior and game. Student behaviors are positively reinforced by being rewarded at the end of the day, class period, or conclusion of the game.
These games are perfect for the little ones, since they need a quicker reinforcement and a visual of desired behaviors. Each game is geared toward a behavior you need improved, such as transitions, class volume, being on task, tattling, kindness, eye contact, listening, following directions, talking, stamina, making smart choices, etc.
These games can be played as a whole class, by table or teams, or individually.
Click any of the listings of each individual game set to see exactly what games are included.
Simply print the games, laminate, and play! Your students will love setting a goal each day and having something to work for! Watch as your students go from being extrinsically motivated to intrinsically motivated!

A classroom community game changer- 16 Weeks of Behavior Focus Meetings to transform your behavior management. Foster a sense of classroom community with good choices and positive behaviors at the core.
What is a Behavior Focus Meeting?
-A time for teachers and students to discuss ways they can positively impact the classroom community. A quick meeting at the start of the week that boosts morale, fosters friendship, and holds students accountable for their choices. Overall, it is a time for students to focus their efforts on building character and developing good habits that can reach beyond the classroom.
Please see the preview for a closer look at the resource.
What is included?
-16 Weeks of Behavior Focus Meeting Prompts in full page size and as chart titles
-In depth Teacher Guide Focus with all prompts, suggested discussion/talking points, and read aloud recommendations for each
-Editable bubbles for you to insert options for students to choose throughout the week
-Weekly/Daily Reflection sheets
-Bulletin board tools ('Behavior Focus Wall' letters + 'This Week's Focus'/'Today's Focus' heading)
Here’s How it Works:
1. Choose a focus prompt. The prompts can be introduced in any order. Decide if you want to use the single page or chart titles.
2. Decide if you want to provide options for students to choose from, then type them into the editable bubbles provided in this download. OR, you can choose to come up with these options collectively.
3. Introduce the behavior focus of the week. Read a suggested read aloud (or another one that you prefer), and use the events from the story, along with the suggested discussion points within the Teacher Guide of this resource, to help students choose what they will focus on this week.
4. Check in with students as the week goes on to see if they’re making progress on their focus. Use teachable moments to remind them of opportunities when they can achieve their goal. Perhaps do another read aloud! :)
5. On Friday, students complete the weekly reflection. Have a mini-celebration to recognize all the good choices students made. Some students can share their successes, touch on how the focus made them more mindful in their daily decision making and what they will take with them from this experience.
*Tip: The more you buy into it, the more your students will!

A - Activity - (Seatwork, centers, science, etc.)
M - Movement - (Stay in your seat, throw away the trash, get water, etc.)
P - Participation - (Actively listening, reading, discussing. etc.)

Every teacher has different expectations, so to help customize this resource to fit your needs this version of my CHAMPS resource also includes some alternatives.

These incentive coupons for academic and behavior reinforcement are perfect for the teacher who wants to give no-cost rewards for student achievement (or behavior). NONE of these rewards require teachers to go out and buy anything. There are 30 reward certificates in the product. Each reward coupon comes in full color and black-and-white (full-size and smaller card-sized versions). You will also find a teacher tips page and a table of contents.

These can be used for a whole class reward system where the whole class earns things, or you can make them individual rewards for whatever you want. Another great idea is to use them in conjunction with your class economy where students can buy these rewards with tickets or money that you give out to the class throughout the day.
This set of coupons includes the following rewards:
Homework Pass
Eat lunch Outside
Read a Book to Another Class
Chew Gum for a Day
Lend a Hand in the School

These rewards certificates are designed to motivate students due to the value of their reward. None (and I mean NONE) of these certificates require a teacher to go out and purchase anything or prepare anything ahead of time.
Please note that these certificates ARE NOT EDITABLE! You will print the certificates, and students will write their names on the card(s) they choose. This product pairs well with ANY established classroom management program.

Set boundaries, promote positive behavior, and reduce negative behavior with these easy-to-use products.
Classroom management is hard. I began my teaching career in an inner-city Title One school, and I quickly learned that is impossible to teach if your classroom isn't well managed. Through trial and error I have developed these products which work in real-world scenarios, and provide the balance of positive reinforcement along with firm boundaries and consequences to create a productive learning environment.
With this bundle you will articulate your expectations, and then reinforce them in a consistent and firm manner. Encourage positive behaviors by rewarding students who exceed expectations, and reduce negative behaviors through documentation and redirection.
Each product in this bundle includes extensive Teaching Guides, where I explain how to implement each product as well as give you tips and tricks that I have learned throughout the years. As with anything, the success of this program depends on how it is used, so I've shared all the wisdom I've got.
BUNDLE INCLUDES:
• Expectation and Zero Tolerance - Printable Posters
• GUESS WHAT - Positive Reward System
• Positive Phone Calls - Learn to use positive parent communication as a behavior tool
• The Behavior Book - Document behavior, redirect, and help students set goals for improvement
PROGRAMS REQUIRED:
- Adobe Acrobat (if you don't have it, it's free!)
- Powerpoint (or a similar program)
- Word (or a similar program)
SUITABLE FOR:
Could be used at any level, but created specifically for middle school classrooms of any discipline.

Why Positive Support Matters:
We understand that managing student behavior can be one of the most challenging aspects of teaching. That's why this resource places a strong emphasis on positive support.
When students receive positive support for their behavior, remarkable things occur:
1. **Empowerment:** Students gain a sense of empowerment as they realize their potential to make better choices and take ownership of their actions.
2. **Respectful Relationships:** Positive support fosters respectful and trusting relationships between teachers and students. It creates an environment where open communication and mutual respect thrive.
3. **Behavioral Growth:** Through positive support, students are encouraged to reflect on their actions, leading to improved self-awareness and better decision-making.
4. **Conflict Resolution:** Students learn effective conflict resolution and problem-solving skills, enabling them to navigate challenges constructively.
5. **Building a Positive Culture:** A classroom rooted in positive support cultivates a culture of respect, empathy, and collaboration—a place where students feel safe and inspired to learn.
Fun and Exciting Behavior Trackers Included:
Looking for a fun and exciting way to track your younger elementary students' behavior? Look no further! This resource includes a variety of behavior trackers, including a hop-to-it tracker, a bingo board tracker, and a tic-tac-toe tracker.
✏️ Editable and Easy to Use:
Simply print, laminate (or place in a dry-erase pouch), and begin tracking and motivating your students. Editable versions of all trackers are included in both color and black and white to make printing easy!
Only a PowerPoint file is included with this resource, making it convenient for teachers to personalize and implement.
Join us in making a positive impact on your students' behavior and building a classroom environment where every student has the opportunity to thrive.

This is an...","Do some (or most) of your students have difficulty with task transitions?
This resource can help! It features several variations of a countdown board, which is a visual support designed to help students ""see"" approximately how much time they have left for a particular task or activity. This is an antecedant-based behavior modification strategy (i.e. an ABA technique) that will work well for children with a variety of learning differences, including autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, anxiety, dyslexia, and intellectual disabilities.
The strategy:
You will start with a countdown or stoplight board that has 3-5 cards on it.
When you introduce an activity or task to your students, tell them how much time they'll have for the entire activity, then let then know how often you remind them of how much time they have left.
After some time has passed, remind students about the upcoming transition, take a card off the countdown board, and put it in the attached envelope. Continue in this manner until there is only one card left on the board.
When it is time for the activity to end, take the last card off the board and place it in the envelope. This serves as a concrete signal to the student(s) that it is time to clean up their materials and move on to the next task or activity.
Variations:
Flip-down boards: instead of removing a card, you just flip down one of the numbered sections on the board.
Multi-step tasks: assign a specific ""step"" to each card on the board.
Reinforcement: student earns a reinforcer when all of the cards are removed or flipped down. For students who have low frustration tolereance for work tasks, you can start with the 3-number boards & work your way up to the ones that have 5 numbers.
Differentiation: if most of your class doesn't need this level of support for transitions, you can use one of the smaller boards with an individual student(s).
This resource includes:
Large, color-coded number cards to make a classroom countdown board
One-page countdown boards to use with individual students. Options: 3 or 5 numbers, color or blackline.
One-page flipdown boards. Options: 3 or 5 numbers, color or blackline.
Large stoplight board template for use with the entire class. (Stoplight is approximately 15 inches long).
One-page stoplight boards for invididual students. Options: color or blackline.

I'd even venture to say, one of the hardest parts about teaching little learners is putting routines, procedures, and rules in place.
We have a big job, but it is also a rewarding one. When you have your classroom management tools in place, everything seems to run a whole lot smoother. So I put together a bundle of my best classroom management resources and share how to apply them in your classroom. Save over 30% with this bundle!
What's included?
Fast Finisher Activities
Do you find that you have some students who get their work done quickly and come running to you saying, ""TEACHER! I'M DONE!!""? To help keep those fast finishers on task when their assigned work is completed, you can create a Fast Finisher station in your classroom. This station is full of engaging activities that foster important skills that your students are sure to love! It will also give you more time to focus on the students that need a little more help from you.
Picture Direction Cards
These picture direction cards are the perfect classroom management strategy for keeping your students on task during a specific assignment. It helps to eliminate mistakes and the ""what do I do next?"" question that our students love to ask. These come in a variety of colors to match your classroom theme.
Classroom Songs
As a teacher, I always find myself singing songs. The students just respond so well to my directions when I add a tune to it! These are songs and chants that I use in my classroom to help with classroom management, calendar time, learning sight words, color words, and more! Plus, singing also helps keep talking to a minimum ;) Audio files are also included so you can easily learn how to sing each song!
Transition Task Cards
In Kindergarten, we transition...A LOT! Transitions can be hard for kids, so the key is to keep them engaged during the transition to avoid getting off-track. There are over 48 transition tasks you can choose from to incorporate into your classroom.
Mystery Word Cards
A fun way to reward your students' great behavior is with a mystery prize! There are 15 different mystery phrases included {in both color and black and white!} for your students to earn. Just print, cut, and hang up on your whiteboard!

What are Token Economies??
Token economies are based on the principles of applied behavior analysis (ABA) and emphasize the use of positive reinforcement to target behavior change. Token economies help students to visualize progress, accept and work for delayed reinforcement, learn to self-monitor, and learn to regulate behavior.
How to Use:
Determine a reinforcer to place next to the box next to the “I am working for” phrase on the token board. Next, reward student with one token for each appropriate behavior they exhibit or after a certain amount of time they have spent on a particular task. Lastly, when student earns all the tokens, immediately reward for the reinforcer the student was working for! Try to reinforce within 60 seconds (The sooner the better!).
How to create?
Download file and open using your preferred method of PDF viewing.
Print pages on CARD STOCK or REGULAR PAPER. (Card stock paper is more durable).
Cut out the Token Board and its corresponding tokens.
Laminate materials with 3mm or 5mm Laminating sheets. (5mm is more durable for long lasting use).
Add velcro onto the token boxes. I also like to add velcro behind the token board to save the tokens from being lost.
Place your PECS or picture icons that student is working for next to “I am working for:” box.

The Premise: Students work together to earn positive class points. When they have more positive points than redirect points, they win! This earns the class a letter in the Mystery Phrase or Star in the Star Jar (choose what fits your class best) that will ultimately lead to a whole class reward!
WHAT'S INCLUDED?

Perfect for a sports themed classroom or just a fun theme to spruce up your behavior clip chart!
All students' clothespins start on ""Batter Up"" and move up or down on the chart based on their choices. This is a great behavior tool because it allows recognition for those who make good choices, rather than all of the attention being on those who are acting up. I recommend moving your students up a lot more than you move them down to make this more of a positive reinforcement.
I also included the ""Home Run!"" award that you can send home with students who get all the way to the top to show their parents. This is a great incentive to get to the top! I included both a boy and girl version of the award and each also comes in black and white for easier printing! The black and white version is really fun to color which can be an additional reward for your little sluggers :)
The ""red"" piece has 3 versions included:
""You're Out!""
""On the Bench""
""Strike Three""
Fun Idea for Use: Every time a student gets to the top of the chart, they can add a small star sticker or jewel or any small decoration to their clip and once they get a certain amount, there is a reward (or it can just be for the sake of making it cute and being able to have as many decorations as possible :))

NEW Mini Lesson INCLUDED*
What is a system? A system is HOW you accomplish the WHAT. We either have systems by intent or by default, but we do have systems. Your classroom environment is a result of what you’ve created OR WHAT YOU’VE TOLERATED.
So the question is where do you see tension in your classroom?
What system do you need to create to get the result you want?
I created a system for behaviors in my classroom that is EFFECTIVE and that allows our class to keep the JOY! After setting and reviewing expectations we then demonstrate the 5 Growth plan to our students so that they know what to expect. Being informed before hand will allow them to make better choices and be less surprised angered & frustrated with the consequences that their actions lead to.

Classroom Management Training E-Book Included!
Just giving you the tools, isn't going to help you transform your mindset around classroom management. That is why I have included a free e-book that walks you through all the parts you need in place to become a classroom management ninja (without all those systems, charts and programs).
An option to watch the trainings via video is included.
Tools Included:
Procedure Cards: Teach common routines in your classroom with visuals. Save your voice and help your littles become more independent.
Classroom Jobs: Build a classroom community where everyone contributes to the classroom everyday. Yep, a job for every student everyday is not only possible but totally worth it.
Visual Schedule Cards: Create stability and encourage that feeling of safety for your students by using and teaching your schedule in a visual format.
Rules & Expectation Posters: Don't let your rules posters just hang on the wall! Use them as a way to help children understand the why behind what we ask them to do (in a visual, kid-friendly way)
Social Emotional Learning Bundle: Teach social-emotional skills in a pro-active manner. While teaching in the moment is super powerful, we can also teach social emotional skills in a group setting. This gives the class the same language and shared experiences that can be drawn on when those social skills are needed in the moment.

"Secret Library Star Rewards: Behavior Management in the Library!","Use these handy certificates to reward students who exhibit excellent behavior in the library!

They can be used as part of a larger behavior management program or as a stand-alone recognition of great behavior. There are 24 different certificates in two sets (""Library Star"" and ""Secret Library Star"").

I had a few classes that were being disruptive during their weekly book exchanges (which can occur at the same time I'm doing projects with other classes)--outside voices, not using shelfmarkers, leaving books on the floor, running, etc. When I started doing this library star “game,” it was like I was seeing a new group of kiddos!

I wrote everyone's names on Popsicle sticks, along with things like “whole class” and “someone wearing blue,” then pull one before that class come to check out (really so I make sure I get to all students at some point!). If they follow all library rules, they earn this certificate to bring home, and the right side goes into the library raffle jar for the end of each month. I have some typical prizes for them to choose from, but most of my kids go right for the “free” prizes, like having lunch with me or an extra book checkout ticket! Now checkout is fun for everyone! 

Here is the storage center I use to organize all of my classes: amzn.to/2HT5lns

Any questions or comments, please let me know! Any feedback and reviews are greatly appreciated.

I have included six different games with themes that are perfect for back to school time. These games will help you focus on a specific behavior that needs improved by the whole group. Once that behavior is corrected, you can move onto another behavior and game. Student behaviors are positively reinforced by being rewarded at the end of the day, class period, or conclusion of the game. These games are perfect for the little ones, since they need a quicker reinforcement of desired behaviors.
The SIX games included are...
•ON BOARD THE ON TASK BUS (Fill the bus with students by staying on task by the end of the day!)
•KINDNESS CHALLENGE (Earn heart game pieces by showing kindness to others. Great for building community!)
•BLURT BUMP (Decrease blurting with this fun game of BUMP!)
•CLEAN UP SHOWDOWN (Fill the bucket with crayons by cleaning up and taking care of the classroom.)
•TIC TAC TATTLE (The classic TIC TAC TOE game with a class vs. teacher twist to decrease tattling on others and encouraging problem solving.)
•GOOD CHOICES VS. POOR CHOICES (Earn game pieces by making good choices.)
Simply print the games, laminate, and play! Your students will love setting a goal each day and having something to work for! Watch as your students go from being extrinsically motivated to intrinsically motivated!

Behavior charts are an effective behavior management tool at school and home. Being a mom and teacher, I found so many tools that are effective at school, can be just as effective at home.
Behavior charts are effective in tracking, documenting, and changing problem behavior. They are most effective when use with positive reinforcement. When children are held accountable and rewarded for their good behavior, we start to see the negative behavior fade away.

21 PDF Home Behavior Charts:
Behavior charts with reminders of ways to earn smiley faces

Product includes intensive teaching guide, attractive phone log, sample scripts, and *NEW* 15 minute instructional video. Perfect way to begin your new school year!

☎ CHECK OUT THE YOUTUBE PREVIEW HERE



With this product you will learn how to use the simple act of calling home as a method of behavior prevention and management. Whether you want to start off the year on the right foot, mend broken relationships from last year, or solve seemingly impossible connections with students in the middle of the school year, this product can help you build strong, positive connections with students that will ultimately win them over.

It sounds simple, I know, but spending 10 minutes using this method of calling home changed the way my students and I connected. My students (yes, even THAT student) began to work harder and treated me with more respect; I began to enjoy my job more, and went home in a much better mood.

------------------------------

PRODUCT INCLUDES:
•A 3 Page Teaching Guide that explains the fundamentals of how to use positive phone calls as an powerful behavior management tool.

•A Phone Call Chart that will teach you how to make positive contact with families in a way that will elicit real change. Calls are broken down into simple steps; sample scripts are provided to help you get started.

•An attractive Positive Phone Log to keep yourself organized.

•A *NEW* 15 minute instructional video that shows examples of phone calls appropriate for different situations, lists the ""Do's and Don'ts"" of calling home, and goes through troubleshooting scenarios. For more details check out the Youtube preview HERE

SUITABLE FOR:
Anybody, really! However, I find that it works wonders for middle school.

We work hard to have great hallway behavior, and often other teachers or staff members notice our great behavior and give us a compliment.
Whenever we earn a compliment, we add a “piece” to our incentive chart. Once we read a certain number, we have some sort of reward (piece of candy or gum, shoes off in the classroom, movie and popcorn, small snack, etc…).

There are many constructive ways to handle student misbehavior. Behavior paragraphs help the student to acknowledge their behavior and the steps they must take to correct it. Have the student copy the applicable paragraph onto notebook paper (as many times as needed at your discretion). To further reinforce, you may want to require a parent signature when they are done. If the whole class is being disruptive, place the appropriate sheet on the Elmo/projector! Works wonders to improve classroom management.

"Traffic Light Behavior Management Packet by Kerry Regenstein | TPT","This packet includes the following letters and forms that I use in my kindergarten classroom:Letter to the Parents:This is a letter that I send home at the beginning of year to explain the classroom behavior system to the parents.Weekly Behavior Chart:I used this behavior chart in my student's Take ...","This packet includes the following letters and forms that I use in my kindergarten classroom:
Letter to the Parents:
This is a letter that I send home at the beginning of year to explain the classroom behavior system to the parents.
Weekly Behavior Chart:
I used this behavior chart in my student's Take Home Folder. In my classroom, I use a light system to monitor behavior throughout the day. At the end of the day the student's are responsible for coloring in the block for the day, either green, yellow, or red to reflect their behavior and then I initial the box to ensure the have correctly recorded their behavior for the day. I also require the parents to initial each night to let me know they have seen the behavior chart. I use the comment section to relay to the parents any issues or accomplishments that the child had throughout the day or the parent can comment in that section back to me about any follow-up they have. Later in the year I will often have the student write what their bad choices were for the day and what the consequences were for their action or what good choices they had made for the day.
Traffic Light Chart:
I print this out on card stock and laminate it to post by the ""How are we doing today?"" pocket chart as a reminder.
""Caught You Being Good"" Slips:
I cut these out and keep them in a basket on my table. Anytime I see a student making exemplary choices, I fill out what I caught them doing as a way to celebrate good behavior. I send the slip home in the student's home folder so the parents can see what their child was doing well with at school that day.
Red Light Report:
I use this form when a student has a red light. At the beginning of the year, I transcribe what the student says on the form. As the year progresses, the student takes over the responsibility of filling out what choices they made and what actions they are going to take to fix the problem.
All letters and forms include a color version and a blackline master.","Early Childhood: 1, PreK: 4, K: 6, 1st: 3, 2nd: 5, 3rd: 4, 4th: 1","4.82","186","2.00","https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Traffic-Light-Behavior-Management-Packet-135854"

-Raffle Tickets (8 to a page)
-Editable Power Point to add your own rewards.
-Editable Power Point to personalize the award message.

Directions:
1. Post the “Secret Student” sign on your white board or as a class webpage announcement to let your class know that you will be looking for a Secret Student and that the Secret Student will be announced by the end of the day! Note: This does not need to be done daily! Although you can or choose the day(s) you want to do this. Keep it a surprise to keep your students on their toes! :) When they see you place the ""Secret Student"" sign up or posted as a class webpage announcement, they will gladly welcome their chance to be the Secret Student!
2. Keep your eye out for the student who has been on task, completed all assignments, and has had excellent behavior.
3. Announce the Secret Student at the end of the day by rewarding him/her with an award certificate! Give the Secret Student a reward card (choose from the ones included or one that you’ve created by using the editable Power point). If there wasn’t anyone on task, no need to announce a name, simply remind everyone to keep doing their best, so that a name can be revealed next time.
4. As an added incentive that will excite your students even further: Raffle tickets can be handed out as a BONUS to those who became a Secret Student! Their raffle ticket can be added to a special jar. The ticket drawn will be the winner (decide on a winning prize such as V.I.P., seat swap, or anything else you see fit)! :)
For Distance Learning:
-Let your student know that you will be posting a “Secret Student” announcement to your class webpage.
-Tell your students that you will be keeping an eye on their work and behavior effort throughout the day, and that a Secret Student MIGHT be made known any time before the end of the day by inserting a virtual award card to an assignment they are working on (use the included PNG to insert the award as a picture). Your students will be anticipating who the Secret Student will be as they are working on their virtual assignments! And the chosen one will be pleasantly surprised to see the virtual award pop up when it's inserted :)
Enjoy!

We love a classroom management plan that doesn't break the bank!
There are many different ways to use them, but my favorite tip is to introduce a few at a time and allow the children to choose their own rewards. Honoring their personal preferences will increase ownership and motivation.

simple text for K-2 students
varied content to appeal to many students
open-ended language so you can set your own terms
both genders

TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY:
Print the coupons on card stock and laminate them for durability. If you have the children return the coupons to you after ""redeeming"" them, you can continue to use the coupons year after year.

They are ZERO prep! No copies! No early finishers! No grading! The best part is, kids LOVE them!
These videos offer a quick, no-prep review that your students are going to love! Each student needs a whiteboard, marker, and eraser.
This set is perfect for back-to-school or anytime you need to review classroom management routines and procedures. Videos include:
Tattling or Telling? - Students hear and see a variety of situations and decide if it is tatting or telling. If it is tattling, they draw a sad face on their boards. If it is telling, they draw a happy face.
Good Choices and bad Choices The following six videos follow the same format. We see kids in different situations and decide if they are making good choices or bad choices. If they are making good choices, we draw a happy face. If they are making bad choices, we draw a sad face.

I have included ten different games with themes that are perfect for the Halloween and Thanksgiving seasons. These games will help you focus on a specific behavior that needs improved by the whole group. Once that behavior is corrected, you can move onto another behavior and game. Student behaviors are positively reinforced by being rewarded with incentives at the end of the day, class period, or conclusion of the game. These games are perfect for the little ones, since they need a quicker reinforcement and visual of desired behaviors.
The TEN games included are...
BATTY BLURT BUMP (Decrease blurting with this fun game of BUMP!)
HAUNTED HELPERS (Earn heart game pieces by HELPING OTHERS. Great for building community!)
A SWEET CHALLENGE (Earn CANDY CORN game pieces by making good choices.)
TRICKY TRANSITIONS (The classic TIC TAC TOE game with a class vs. teacher twist to increase smooth, quick, and quiet transitions.)
SPOOKY SIT and SCOOT (NEW!) (Students play against the teacher in this board game focused on staying in seat and asking for permission to leave seat.)

This social skills sorting activity will help students learn how to act in school and how to listen in the classroom.
Social skills allow us to communicate and problem solve. For students with special needs and more specifically, our friends with Autism, we need to teach them these skills.
Knowing how to act in school is an important social skill. Certain inappropriate behaviors are not tolerated and students need to be able to distinguish appropriate from inappropriate behaviors.
BONUS LESSON
Whole Body Listening - A sorting mat for students to learn how to use their whole body to focus while listening.
You can use this in two ways:
1. Give each student a blank mat and set of sorting cards. One by one, sort the cards and glue them to the sorting mat. This works great during whole group instruction.
2. Print the sorting mat and cards on cardstock and laminate. Use Velcro and create an interactive page for students to use and reuse. This works great for individual instruction or a quick social skills reminder lesson (as shown in preview).

This is my go-to system for hallway behavior!
We work hard to have great hallway behavior, and often other teachers or staff members notice our great behavior and give us a compliment.
Whenever we earn a compliment, we add a “piece” to our incentive chart. Once we read a certain number, we have some sort of reward (piece of candy or gum, shoes off in the classroom, movie and popcorn, small snack, etc…).
These incentive charts can be used for:
- Whole Class
- Small Groups
- Homework
- Attendance
- Individual Students
- Class Compliments
- Student Groups/Teams

http://teachtworeach.blogspot.com/2014/02/bright-math-ideas-blog-hop-money.html

This a behavior incentive program that allows you to practice the concept of money throughout the year. Students can earn or lose money based on certain behaviors. They see a display chart that tells them the behaviors that they can earn or lose money for and how much money they will get or get taken away. They have to be responsible for collecting their money properly, knowing how much to give and take back, and even trading up once they have enough (such as trading in 5 nickels for a quarter).

Pretend money has been provided that can be copied and handed out. The coins are made larger on purpose so that they are not easily lost. Students can get a mini file folder from the dollar spot at Target or the dollar store to keep track of their money. Or they can have their own pockets hanging from a wall display underneath the rest of the posters. I used to have students keep their money in zip lock bags and it was their responsibility to keep it all safe. They don’t get lost money back.

They can only gain access to the party (which I did every 2 to 3 weeks on a Friday), if they have enough money for the entrance ($5.00). The initial item (pizza slice, cupcake, etc.) is free, but any additional item such as candy, a drink, toppings, etc., cost more money. So the more money students have, the more they can get at the party. They can choose to save some of their money to roll over for the next party if you wish to do it that way. The day of the party, they come pay you for what they want and have to give you the money and ask for the correct change back if needed. LOTS OF MONEY PRACTICE!!



**4 types of parties display posters (CUPCAKE, PIZZA, MOVIE, AND ICECREAM – one version that has prices and one without which is editable so you can fill it out on your own. Plus a 5th blank editable one is provided so you can make up your own party.

**How to earn money and how to lose money posters. ..3 versions – one with behaviors and money amounts, editable one with behaviors and no money amounts so you can type the amounts in, and one that is blank so you can type in your own behaviors and money amounts

**Headings for a display board..title of “Saving Up For Our…” and then separate heading for each party, plus a blank one if you want to create your own version of a party.

**Entrance tickets for each party– colored and (mostly) uncolored version. Blank entrance ticket also provided to fill in for your own type of party

**Pretend money you can choose to copy onto colored cardstock or paper to laminate and give out to students as they earn the money. There are bills from $1.00 to $20.00 (so kids can trade in), and there are two versions of each bill. In the middle it either says “Party Money,” or “Classroom Money.”

**There are also pretend coins from 1 penny to the half dollar. These can be copied onto colored paper and handed out to kids, and the kids can trade them in for larger value coins or bills once they get enough.
The paper money is optional. Of course you can also you pretend money bills and coins that you can find at different stores","1st: 5, 2nd: 12, 3rd: 8, 4th: 8, 5th: 4, 6th: 1","4.86","231","4.00","https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Behavior-Management-System-Classroom-Economy-Money-editable-1126757"

RULES POSTERS
The posters include five essential rules for any classroom and will work for any age group:
Stay On Task
Respect Others
Follow Directions
Work Quietly
Clean Up Our Mess
These five rules are all you really need to cover most behaviors. They are clear and easy to understand, written as student-friendly and positive ""We will"" statements.
These rule posters feature bright colors to fit in with any classroom theme or decor.
BEHAVIOR REPORT
This resource also includes a Weekly Behavior Report to send home to parents. There is a spot to indicate ""Great Day"" or to mark which of the five rules the student had trouble following. At the bottom, there is space for teacher and parent comments.
This is a fillable form. That means it has clickable fields and text boxes you can type into before printing. You can also print and fill out by hand if you prefer.

This is my go-to system for hallway behavior!
We work hard to have great hallway behavior, and often other teachers or staff members notice our great behavior and give us a compliment.
Whenever we earn a compliment, we add a “piece” to our incentive chart. Once we read a certain number, we have some sort of reward (piece of candy or gum, shoes off in the classroom, movie and popcorn, small snack, etc…).
These incentive charts can be used for:
- Whole Class
- Small Groups
- Homework
- Attendance
- Individual Students
- Class Compliments
- Student Groups/Teams
This whole class behavior tracker is part of my Class Behavior Incentives {A Growing Bundle}.
If you already own the Class Behavior Incentives {A Growing Bundle}, do not purchase this - you already own it!

This resource has over 170 Spanish poster options to customize the system to meet your needs!
Stop behavior issues before they start with this organized system. CHAMPS is not a system of rules and consequences.  It’s a way to clearly communicate to your students in a positive manner making it easier for expectations to be met. 
CHAMPS communicates 6 expectations:
C - Conversation (no talking, whisper voice, presentation voice, etc.)
H - Help - (Raise your hand, ask a neighbor, ask 3 before me, etc.)
A - Activity - (Seatwork, centers, science, etc.)
M - Movement - (Stay in your seat, throw away the trash, get water, etc.)
P - Participation - (Actively listening, reading, discussing. etc.)
S - Success - (Star Students, Super Students, etc.)
Every teacher has different expectations, so to help customize this resource to fit your needs this version of my CHAMPS resource also includes some alternatives. 
For ""P"" there are also cards for post activity to communicate what students should do at the end of each activity. For ""S"" there are also options for supplies or signals that they would listen for when the activity is over.
You’ll be shocked how quickly your students catch on to this system! You’ll get fewer interruptions with students asking what they should be doing. CHAMPS gives students the non-verbal cues they need to be successful!

This calm corner toolbox , aka take a break station includes self regulation coping skills, mindfulness exercises and calming strategies to regulate anger, anxiety, impulsivity and overwhelming feelings. This safe space kit helps you create a trauma-informed classroom filled with behavior interventions that are mindfulness-based. By teaching students self-regulation, you will cut down on the time you spend redirecting misbehavior. The calming kit includes a mood meter for assessing current emotional levels. After using the counseling activities in the kit, students assess their mood again to decide if they are ready to return to the group.
*Relatable to most grade levels from 2nd to 7th!
How to Create a Calm Down Corner with this Kit
Attach cover page to the front of a binder.
Place the colorful pages in sheet protectors and place them in a spiral binder. Students will be able to write on them over and over again.
Place the binder in a basket or box.
Add other fidgets and sensory tools to the box.
Create a corner of the room with a comfy chair for using the box or basket.
Use the enclosed poster to designate your calming area.
I would also suggest including a sand timer or other method of tracking time.
Who would benefit from this kit?
This print-ready kit can be used by school counselors, classroom teachers, special education teachers, school psychologists, social workers, or any other educator who helps children with emotional regulation.

These token systems can be used for elementary-aged children for behavior management and behavioral support or reinforcing correct responding or being on-task in working. There are 10 boards with different themes including princess, train, swimmer, artist, wrestler, and race cars. For each theme there is a 10-token board and a 5-token board.
****This product is also included in a bundle offered at a discounted price: The Starter Kit for Successful Inclusion
I included visuals that can be used as tokens, but the boards will also work well with pennies or other coins. I like buying cute buttons from the fabric store, putting velcro on the back (pop the loop off the back if you need to) and using those. Of course be careful about whether the student is one who might eat small objects. You could also use a dry erase marker to put stars in the boxes as tokens (less pieces to lose).
I have also included some visuals for common reinforcers and suggestions for using the systems.
I hope your students enjoy them as much as mine have.

13 Premade Behavior Contracts
☺ Chart 1: Attendance : This chart is useful for students who are truant. I often use this before a student is report to the truancy officer or when grades are being effected by school absences.
☺ Chart 2: Bus : Use this chart for students who have had a bus offense or have had a history of problems while riding school transportation. This can also be useful for extracurricular activities that require transportation.
☺ Chart 3: Citizenship : This should be utilized for students who bully and have repeated offenses of inappropriate communication or social interaction with others.
☺ Chart 4: Class Communications : This chart is useful for students who talk out of turn during class and verbally disrupt instruction.
☺ Chart 5: Homework : Use this chart to establish guidelines for students who either don’t turn in assignments or have 5 or more missing homework assignments.
☺ Chart 6: Honesty : useful for students who steal. Can also be used for those who steal and lie but for lying only use the Truth Contract.
☺ Chart 7: Physical Self-Control : This is my go to contract for useful for students who are physically aggressive towards peers or adults. I find this contract very important in a behavior plan so the parent understands that no level of physical aggression is acceptable and that they are well informed on the consequences.
☺ Chart 8: Preparedness : This contract is useful for the students who come to class with no supplies and are always asking for a pencil or a piece of paper.
☺ Chart 9: Punctuality : This contract is similar to the Attendance Contract but is more useful for students who are often tardy before the start of class periods.
☺ Chart 10: Respect : Use this contract for students who are disrespectful to adults.
☺ Chart 11: Respect of Property : This contract is useful for students who vandalize.
☺ Chart 12: Truth : Useful for students who chronically lie and have social, academic or criminal problems due to lying. Can be used in conjunction with the Honesty Contract if lying and stealing are a combination concern.
☺ Chart 13: Work Completion : This is helpful for students who don’t complete work even when given time in class to finish.
☺ Chart 14: Behavior Contract Template : This is helpful for making your own contracts.

Reward Coupons and Incentives for Middle School and High School Students is a great behavioral management system. Students are able to earn reward incentives through their kind deeds, actions, and performance in class. This is also great for those students who need a little incentive to get busy on an assignment or who need a little praise for effort. These are perfect for students in grades 5-12!
I keep these reward incentives in an index card holder for easy access, and it takes up less space around my desk. The students are able to ‘cash-in’ their incentives at certain times that I set up in the classroom. I have found these reward incentives save me a lot of time correcting negative behavior, and we are able to focus more on positive behaviors and learning. The fabulous thing about these incentives is you can use them year after year!
There are two versions included in this download: a color version of the 35 rewards and incentives and a black and white version of the rewards and incentives. I have included a handout stating what I use each incentive for so it will give the teacher an idea; however, please tailor them to your classroom and students.
The 35 incentives included are:
No Homework Pass
Extra Credit
2nd Chance Card
Sweet Tooth
Music to My Ears
Thirst Quencher
Hungry, Hungry Student
Errand Runner
Extra Screen Time

With the help from this book, you can restore all the fun back into your classroom.
I am here to help you face the common social issues found in modern-day classrooms so that you can get back to those exciting lessons you love to teach.
Why will you love this product?
❤This product contains TWO guidebooks: One for NEW TEACHERS and another for VETERAN TEACHERS.
❤You will also receive a BONUS folder complete with helpful items you may need throughout the year.
Here is what you will find in these books:
Reflection - We will take a deep look into what you have done in the past and reflect on what did and did not work. New teachers will reflect on what was learned throughout student teaching or any other teaching experiences.
A Complete Classroom Management Plan - Here I will share my exact plan that I used in my classroom. I used bits and pieces from the research I did and made them work seamlessly. I share all details of this and give it to you so you can use it in your classroom if you wish. If you do not want to use it all, that is fine too! Use whatever you'd like. My plan includes:
Social Skills
Manners Lesson
Lesson Reflection
Discipline
Consequences
Behavior Calendars
Absences and Tardiness
Atmosphere
Music In the Classroom
Connect With Your Students
Transitions and Time Management
Keeping Your Room Tidy and Organized
Classroom Jobs

YOUR Complete Classroom Management Plan - Once you read what I used, if you want to build your own personalized plan, this is where to do it. With guided sections, you will map out exactly what you want YOUR plan to look like down to every last detail.

Here is what you will find in your BONUS folder
✔Notes home to parents that explain parts of my behavior plan.
✔Forms and tools to help you stay organized
This set also works well for district professional development. I am a firm believer that an entire school should be on the same page when it comes to behavior management. With my strategies and lessons with social skills, I suggest these to be spiraled from elementary throughout high school. While they work in individual classrooms, there will be great success for each child if these strategies continue with them throughout their education.

""This is an absolutely invaluable resource - I am getting ready to start my fifth year of teaching and have NEVER felt as prepared going into the school year as I do now that I have gone through this material. THANK YOU so much!""
-Kelly
This resource completely changed my first year of teaching. 2-3 weeks in, I was struggling and my kids were crazy. Now, everything is running so much more smoothly and I have Ashley to thank for that! I honestly emailed her to tell her how much I appreciated this resource. The behavior calendars in here have been game changers for my students. They are accountable for their actions and parents LOVE it!
-Lauren
Ashley is very thorough with 83 easy-to-read pages of classroom management techniques that she has researched and tested. She also includes a lot of bonuses in this purchase so you don't have to buy anything extra to apply her ideas.

Each full-color poster now also includes an INK-FRIENDLY OPTION and a BLANK OPTION. Both versions allow for individual personalization and provide kids with the opportunity to brainstorm additional ideas for each subject or topic.
THIS SET FEATURES:
The Parts of a Reader
The Parts of a Writer
The Parts of a Mathematician
The Parts of a Scientist
The Parts of an Explorer
The Parts of a Historian
The Parts of an Artist
The Parts of a Musician
The Parts of an Athlete
The Parts of a Friend
The Parts of a Listener
The Parts of a Teacher

❤️ New in 2024: After requests to bring back the original poster set using the Scrappin' Doodles clip art, I've included those posters as a BONUS SET in this PDF. See the last page in the PREVIEW for sample posters from that 2012 set.

**Best Seller **
One of our biggest challenges as teachers is helping our kiddos learn expected school behavior in a positive encouraging way. For 23 years, I've been using these daily behavior plans to help my challenging students learn expected school behavior and to make good choices at school.
Whenever I experience a student who needs a little extra support to follow the rules, be respectful, and work hard, I can usually count on one of these daily communication plans to help get us on track. Here's what works for me...
Each plan is a little different, and choosing the right one is key. I choose a plan that matches the student's needs. I begin by meeting with the student and often with the parents to explain that this plan will be coming home each day. I ask the parent(s) to sign and return the plan the following day. Together, the student, the parents, and I decide what rewards and/or consequences will follow a great day vs. a stinky day. This usually leads to a great discussion about age appropriate rewards and consequences. We all agree, in front of the student, to stick to the plan.
The plan takes very little time to implement. I start each day with a positive meeting with the kiddo, letting him/her know that I believe in him/her and that it's going to be a great day! Then, we have a quick two minute meeting near the end of the day, reflecting on the day and the choices that the student made throughout the day. The student fills in the paper with a highlighter while I watch (making sure it's accurate.) Sometimes I jot a note to the parents about an incident or a problem that occurred that day. I always initial the plan as a way of letting the parent know that I've seen it before sending it home. When the student has a great day, I write something big and inspiring all over the page. My favorites: It was a Wowie Zowie day! Today was a Zippity Doo Da Day! Joey Rocks! Joey was a model of self-control today! The kiddo takes it home, gets it signed, and returns it to my teacher mailbox in the morning.
Sometimes I use an incentive charts to track the number of good days and set a reward for __?_ good days in a row. Once I see steady progress with a lot of good days in a row, we talk about phasing out the plan. I've included several of the incentive charts in the bundle.
Here's what's included:
11 Daily behavior plans
10 Incentive charts to track progress
4 Pages of reward tickets/coupons
1 Thank you note from the teacher
These have been lifesavers for me over the years. I hope you find them useful too!
Enjoy!
